# JetBrains_internship_button_plugin

Implementation of a button plugin for the test task of the JetBrains ["IDE Plugin for JetBrains WebTeamUI frontend library"](https://internship.jetbrains.com/projects/1332/) internship.

---

This project's structure was created with IntelliJ's new plugin project creation. The actual code can be found in [src/main/java/com/lucsalvon/jetbrains_internship_button_plugin](https://github.com/Luc-Salvon/JetBrains_internship_button_plugin/tree/main/src/main/java/com/lucsalvon/jetbrains_internship_button_plugin).

When run, the plugin can be found in menus Tools -> Internal actions -> UI -> Demos -> Internship button. It will launch a modal window containing two buttons which, when clicked, open links in an internal web browser on a new window.

### Thanks for checking out my application :D
